1) using cin and cout, accept name,address,age of a person and print it.

2) write a function which can accept minimum 3 characters and maximum 5 characters and display them.

3) create following structure
struct book
{
	char bid[5];
	char name[30];
	int price;
};
ask user how many records he wants to create and accordingly allocate memory.
accept values from user and display.
( Hint :-  use  "new" operator)

4)define 3 different structures and initialize their members.
now write 3 different functions,but with the same name.
these functions will accept each structure respectively and display their members.

5) define a function "int sqr(int);
create a pointer pointing to this function. now using pointer invoke this function.

6) given int arr[5]={10,20,30,40,50}
now write a function which can collect this array. inside function display all the elements.

7) define a function , in which create int array of 5, initialize it. now return this array from a function , collect it inside the main function and display the elements.

8) create a static library in c in which,
write a function which will accept 2 numbers and return the difference between 2 numbers
write appropriate header file.

write c client code to access this library.
