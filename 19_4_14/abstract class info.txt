abstract class

in c++ the moment u declare at least one pure virtual function inside the class, it becomes abstract class.

abstract class can not be instantiated, but a pointer or reference of abstract class can be created ( for late binding purpose)

abstract class can contain pure virtual , virtual or non-virtual functions.

child class of abstract class has to define pure virtual function which is declared in the parent class.
