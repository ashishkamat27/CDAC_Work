1) class Group1
   {
	char *name;
	int total;

	// constructors and member functions
   }
in main function create 2 groups with name and total marks.
now write a friend function,which will compare total of 2 groups and display the result.

2) 
class First
{
	int a;
};
class Second
{
	public:
		void fun1(){}
		void fun2(){}
		void fun3(){}
};

Above code is incomplete.
Make sure that all the member functions of "Second" will access "a".
