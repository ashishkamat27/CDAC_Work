Looking at the example of a power steering mechanism of a car. Power steering of a car is a complex system, which internally have lots of components tightly coupled together, they work synchronously to turn the car in the desired direction. It even controls the power delivered by the engine to the steering wheel. But to the external world there is only one interface is available and rest of the complexity is hidden. Moreover, the steering unit in itself is complete and independent. It does not affect the functioning of any other mechanism.
