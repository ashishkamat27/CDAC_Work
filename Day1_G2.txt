1) create a library to define following class
class Sample
{
 int data
\\ here
}

client of this library should do following

Sample s1(200);
cout<<m1.getData();
Sample s2=s1;
Sample s3;
s3.setData(400);
if(s2==s3)
{
cout<<"equal";
}
else
{
cout<<"not equal";
}
cout<<Sample::getCount()<<endl; // count of how many instances are created



2)create a class "Employee" with
int id
char *empname
int age

define parameterized constructor only for this class.
define 3 getter functions.

now create 2 instances
1 on stack and 1 on heap.
pass the necessary values while creating instances.
call the getter functions.
